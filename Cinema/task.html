  <p>The cinema has <strong>n</strong> rows, each row consists of <strong>m</strong> seats (<strong>n</strong> and <strong>m</strong> do not exceed 20). The two-dimensional matrix stores the information on the sold tickets, number <strong>1</strong> means that the ticket for this place is already sold, the number <strong>0</strong> means that the place is available. You want to buy <strong>k</strong> tickets to the neighboring seats in the same row. Find whether it can be done.</p> 
  <p><strong>Input data format</strong></p> 
  <p>On the input, the program gets the number of <strong>n</strong> rows and <strong>m</strong> seats. Then, there are n lines, each containing <strong>m</strong> numbers (<strong>0</strong> or <strong>1</strong>) separated by spaces. The last line contains a number <strong>k</strong>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Output data format</strong></p> 
  <p>The program should output the number of the row with <strong>k</strong> consecutive available seats. If there are several rows with <strong>k</strong> available seats, output the first row with these seats. If there is no such a row, output the number 0.</p>
