 <body>
  <p>You are asked to perform a security audit in a baking company. Their products are represented by <code class="language-java">Bakery</code> class and its different subclasses like <code class="language-java">Cake</code> and <code class="language-java">LemonTart</code>. All the pastries are sold in nice boxes. Prior to being released to the customer, all boxes are checked with carefully designed <code class="language-java">NaiveQualityControl</code> class. However, recently a number of mistakes happened and unedible things were packed in boxes and escaped the quality check.</p> 
  <p>A short look at <code class="language-java">NaiveQualityControl</code> led you to the conclusion that it's quite easy to provide <code class="language-java">NaiveQualityControl</code> with <code class="language-java">Box</code> filled with <code class="language-java">Paper</code> that will pass QC. Now your task is to demonstrate this mistake. Here's the code:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">/* This class and its subclasses should pass quality check */
class Bakery {}

class Cake extends Bakery {}

/* This one should not */
class Paper {}

/* These boxes are used to pack stuff */
class Box&lt;T&gt; {
    void put(T item) { /* implementation omitted */ }
    T get() { /* implementation omitted */ }
}

/* This quality checker ensures that boxes for sale contain Bakery and anything else */
class NaiveQualityControl {
  
  public static boolean check(List&lt;Box&lt;? extends Bakery&gt;&gt; boxes) {
    /* Method signature guarantees that all illegal 
       calls will produce compile-time error... or not? */  
    return true;  
  }
  
}</code></pre> 
  <p>You need to add implementation to <code class="language-java">Violator.defraud()</code> method that will do the following:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Create <code class="language-java">List of Boxes&lt;? extends Bakery&gt;</code> according to the method signature</li> 
   <li>Put <code class="language-java">Paper</code> object in at least one <code class="language-java">Box</code> in the list</li> 
   <li>The resulting list should pass <code class="language-java">NaiveQualityControl</code>check</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Do not change the method signature or code of any other classes, just add implementation to defraud method.</p>
