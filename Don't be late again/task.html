  <p>Yesterday an unfortunate thing happened. You wanted to visit a grocery store, it was late and one by one the stores already started to close. You've decided to go to Kwik-E-Mart to buy some doughnuts, but when you reached it, the store was already closed.</p> 
  <p>To avoid such situations, you've prepared a list of stores nearby with their closing time. To get to any of them you need exactly <strong>30 minutes</strong>. </p> 
  <p>Now your job is to write a program that determines which stores you will be able to reach today if you go out at exactly <strong>19:30</strong>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Input data format</strong></p> 
  <p>The first line contains a number of stores in the list. The following lines contain information about the stores with two attributes: <em>store name</em> and the<em> closing time.</em> They are separated by one space (a name cannot have spaces).</p> 
  <p><strong>Output data format</strong></p> 
  <p>Grocery stores you will be able to reach in 30 minutes. The order of stores in the output should be the same as in the input. Each store is in a new line.</p>
